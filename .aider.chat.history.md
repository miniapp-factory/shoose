#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – create a new file that describes the logo image to be generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I can update the metadata and create the logo description file.  
Please add the new file `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` to the chat so I can provide the full *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for it.

#### apply changes  

I need the current contents of `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` so I can match the exact lines to replace. Once you provide that, I can generate the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for updating the title and description, and I’ll also create the new `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` file.
